title: Render when piping
---
See the [useIsPiping](../hooks/use-is-piping) hook for details 
about how to conditionally render something when the pipeline is in an executing (piping) state.
The `useIsPiping` hook can be utilized in your own components.

You can alternatively use the provided [WhenIsPiping](../conditionals/when-is-piping) 
or [WhenIsNotPiping](../conditionals/when-is-not-piping) conditional components.
It is the preferred approach for most use-cases.
